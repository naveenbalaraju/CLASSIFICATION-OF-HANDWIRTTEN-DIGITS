# CLASSIFICATION-OF-HANDWIRTTEN-DIGITS
1. This Ipython notebook explains the classification of handwritten MNIST dataset using Deep Neural networks,Logistics regression and SVM.

2. For Exploratory data analysis, I've excercised PCA and T-SNE data visualization techniques. 

3. Built classifier using Deep Neural networks,Logistics regression and SVM and evaluated their performance.
